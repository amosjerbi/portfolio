## Environment Variables

This project requires the following environment variables to be set up in a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_instagram_token_here
```

Make sure to:
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add your Instagram access token
3. Never commit the `.env` file to version control (it's already in .gitignore)
